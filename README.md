Text-to-Avatar Application
Description
This is a Text-to-Avatar application where users can generate avatars by typing a descriptive text. The application uses a front-end React-based UI and simulates avatar generation with image placeholders. In a production environment, you would integrate with an API to generate avatars dynamically.

The app includes the following features:

Text input for users to describe avatars
Gender-based avatar selection (male/female)
Example prompts for quick testing
Modern UI with a two-column layout
Responsive design and hover effects
Avatar generation simulation with different images (placeholder)
Features
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works across different screen sizes.
Avatar Generation: Users can input a description and see a randomly selected avatar (simulated with placeholders).
Gender-Specific Avatars: The app detects gender from the text and generates corresponding avatars.
Example Prompts: Predefined avatar descriptions for quick testing.
Interactive UI: Hover effects and loading states make the experience more engaging.
Gradient Background: Stylish background for modern aesthetics.
Avatar Variations: Multiple avatars generated at once for more choice.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js (with TypeScript)
Styling: CSS for layout and UI elements
Avatar Images: Unsplash image placeholders (for demo)
State Management: React state and hooks
Build Tool: Vite for fast development
